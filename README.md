# School District Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
### Purpose
In this project, we analyzed standardized testing scores from a school system district to gather and report trends.  Maria has tasked us with cleaning the data, generating a school district summary, and a school summary. From those summaries we are able to conclude the high and low performing schools, the average math and reading scores by grade, and determine the effect that school spending, school size, and school type has on the schoolâ€™s math and reading scores. The information that we are providing Maria with will encourage discussions and strategic decisions that are made at the school and district level. After analyzing our data, the school board informed Maria that the math and reading scores reported for the 9th graders of Thomas High School showed academic dishonesty. Therefore, we excluded those results and repeated our school district analysis.
## Results
* As you can see, when the 9th graders math and reading scores from Thomas High School were counted as "NaN" (not a number) the distict's percentage of students passing math dropped from 75% to 74.8%. Additionally, the percentage of students passing reading droppend from 86% to 85.7%. The overall percentage of passing students dropped by 0.1%. The first photo displays the District's original DataFrame and the bottom photo displays the District's new DataFrame without the 9th graders results.

<ul><li> As for the school summary, only Thomas High School is affected. This is shown in the two photos displayed in the next bullet.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores only affected Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools. If you compare the original school summary (first photo) to the updated school summary (second photo) without Thomas High School's ninth graders' test results, you can see that all of the other schools' data remains the same. Whereas Thomas High Schools' average math score, percentage of students passing math and reading, and overall percentage of students passing the standardized tests decreased. The average reading score, however, slightly increased from 83.85% to 83.90%. The average math score decreased from 83.42% to 83.35%. The percentage of students passing math decreased from 93.27% to 93.19%. The percentage of students passing reading decreased from 97.31% to 97.02%. The overall percentage of students passing the math and reading exams decreased from 90.95% to 90.63%. </li></ul>

<ul><li> In the DataFrame for math and reading scores by grade, the ninth-grade scores for Thomas High School is now presented as nan. No other schools' grades for each grade is affected. Thomas High School's 10th, 11th, and 12th math and reading scores are not affected as well. The orignial DataFrames are displayed in the first two pictures (math on top and reading on bottom) and the new DataFrames are displayed below with math scores by grade on top and reading scores by grade on bottom.</li></ul>

## Summary
After replacing Thomas High School's ninth grade's math and reading score, Thomas High Schools' average math score, percentage of students passing math and reading, and overall percentage of students passing decreased. The average reading score slightly increased although. The average math score decreased from 83.42% to 83.35%. The percentage of students passing math decreased from 93.27% to 93.19%.
